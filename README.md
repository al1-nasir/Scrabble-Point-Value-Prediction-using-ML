# Scrabble-Point-Value-Prediction-using-ML
end-to-end-scrabble-point-value-prediction
I'm exited to share my performance in the kaggle competition where I surpassed 4th position . Target was to predict the point value of the next play in the game of Scrabble i-e my favourite childhood game. Model was trained by levaraging scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library named XGBRegressor and CatBoostRegressor as base model. Finally to optimize model , I fine-tuned hyper-parameters using RandomizedSearchCV.

As I have just started participating in these competition, So I couldn't find any active competition related to it. My notebook went to late submission as competition got closed . Thanks for your time.
